\section{Conclusions}


In this paper, we have designed and implemented CS-ASL, which leverages dual-microphone smartphone array to achieve acoustic source localization using unreliable binary node sequences.
%
The proposed design formulates acoustic source localization as the sparse recovery problem of 1-bit compressive sensing  by making use of the binary sequence from the smartphone array. Since our system runs on COTS smartphones and supports spontaneous setup, it has potential to enable a wide range of distributed acoustic sensing. Besides the CS-ASL-BF, CS-ASL-GD and CS-ASL-LR are proposed for further enhancing system robustness.
%
Our methods are verified and evaluated through analysis and experiments. According to the results, our method can effectively implement robust acoustic source localization with light communication overhead. 
%
%Our next step is that designing the scheme to find the smartphones with bit-flipping in the sensor network to further improve the performance of the localization system.
